    # currently there's a risk that when we run this step the cluster is already destroyed since it was created in a previous step
    # for the sake of simlicity it is kept like this here
    # however, in production with longer pipelines: more services and more tests it will most likely start causing issues
    # creation of the cluster and deployment to it should be in the same step as the e2e tests running
